# Getting Started

Published on 2025-05-05

Welcome to _my_new_ blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I have accomplished

**Installing Astro** First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
**Making Progress**:I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages`
folder.

**Making Blog Posts** This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
